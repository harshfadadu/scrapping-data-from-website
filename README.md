# scrapping-data-from-website
There are 4 different website from which stock news is scrapped: [Moneycontrol, IIFL, BusinessToday, investing.com].   
IIFL will take much more time to run.   
Fatest is moneycontrol. You will get more data from BusinessToday but the news relevance is not much more.
News from investing.com is accurate and large number.
